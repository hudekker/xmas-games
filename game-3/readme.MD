1. First load up the user's pictures in `assets-user`.  Copy paste the original filenames, no need to rename

2. Then run the following command in the terminal to create the JSON file 'assets-user/pictures.json':

    ```bash 
    ./generate_json.sh
    ``` 

3. Next, push to GitHub.

4. Finally, create the github webpage if it isn't already created.

**To prep ahead of time, you can already create shells in GitHub and associated webpages. Then just do #1 and #2, and push; then you are done.**
